# Selected-Work.com

This repository was started for the Stackathon project at Fullstack Academy of Code. It is software intended to simplify the process of creating a website for one's painting, scultpure or printmaking.

Offering a free tool online for artists and art students to publish their work online in an easy to navigate process is the goal. The design of the website created by a user will be tailor made to visual art and not photography as is often the case. A user should be able to generate a website in a short amount of time without technical know-how and the website should have the priorites of a visual artist in mind.

For example, images will appear with a generous amount of whitespace and not be fullscreen as these often hinder the impression the work makes when viewing online. Additionally, each detail should be thoughtfully designed and should not feature any marketing or logos from the software nor should anything appear in the user interface which detracts from the artwork - precisley the standard in person galleries set for their exhibitions.
